Around the point in time where I started working on the reminder mailer, I
started to feel a bit of the ill effects of cowboy coding rather than having a
more structured (i.e. test-driven) flow. But since I was still trying to figure
out the requirements of the project at that time, I was hesitant to formalize my
efforts -- I wanted to focus on the product, not the code.

Working on the timezone support and storage of reminder times reminded me how
much I hate anything to do with temporal logic. After looking around at some
options, I decided to use the ugly Time.zone = ... before_filter which has
global side effects (but those are mitigated because we're not processing
concurrent requests, right?), and to record reminder times as integer offsets
rather than text fields or time fields. All of this feels like ugly hackery. :-/
